# Diabetes Prediction using Support Vector Machine (SVM)
This repository contains Python code for predicting the likelihood of diabetes based on patient health metrics using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model.

Project Description
The project utilizes the Pima Indians Diabetes Database to train and evaluate an SVM classifier. The process includes:

Loading and exploring the dataset.
Data preprocessing, including standardization of features.
Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
Training a linear SVM model.
Evaluating the model's accuracy on both training and testing data.
Making predictions on new data points.
Setup
To run this code, you will need to have Python and the following libraries installed:

pandas
numpy
